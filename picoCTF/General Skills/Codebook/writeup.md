# Codebook
## Description

* [Download code.py](code.py)
* [Download codebook.txt](codebook.txt)
## Hints
1. On the webshell, use ```ls``` to see if both files are in the directory you are in
2. The ```str_xor``` function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.
## Solution
1. Run the script.
```
% python code.py
picoCTF{c0d3b00k_455157_197a982c}
```
