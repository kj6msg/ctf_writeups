# Wave a Flag
## Description
Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? [This program](warm) has extraordinarily helpful information...
## Hints
1. This program will only work in the webshell or another Linux computer.
2. To get the file accessible in your shell, enter the following in the Terminal prompt: `$ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/a14be2648c73e3cda5fc8490a2f476af/warm`
3. Run this program by entering the following in the Terminal prompt: `$ ./warm`, but you'll first have to make it executable with `$ chmod +x warm`
4. -h and --help are the most common arguments to give to programs to get more information from them!
5. Not every program implements help features like -h and --help.
## Solution
1. Run the program.
```console
% ./warm
Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!
% ./warm -h
Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_755f3544}
```
