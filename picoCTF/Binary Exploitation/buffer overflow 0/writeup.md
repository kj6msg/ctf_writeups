# buffer overflow 0
## Description
Smash the stack  
Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available [here](vuln). You can view source [here](vuln.c). And connect with it using:  
`nc saturn.picoctf.net 51110`
## Hints
1. How can you trigger the flag to print?
2. If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.
3. Run man gets and read the BUGS section. How many characters can the program really read?
## Solution
1. `gets` is susceptible to a buffer overflow attack. We expect the stack in `vuln` to be at least 19 deep (`buf2`, `input`, `EBP`, and the return address). Add some padding for good measure... like the hint said, sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.
```console
% nc saturn.picoctf.net 51110
Input: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_8ba275ff}
```
